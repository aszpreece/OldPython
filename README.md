# Final Year Project

My final year project. Includes implementation of 'neat' algorithm.

## Setting up your environment

1. If you don't have it installed already, install virtualenv by following instructions [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).
2. At root directory of the project, create a new virtual environment using `python3 -m venv env` on mac and `py -m venv env`.
3. Add the following line to the file at {virtual environment name}/bin/activate : `export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/project/root/directory"`.
4. Activate your virtual environment using `source env/bin/activate` on mac and `.\env\Scripts\activate` on windows.
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
6. Run code as expected.
